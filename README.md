# GUI-based-TFAP
The project is a GUI based transfer function analysis package programmed on Python using TKinter GUI package.
It takes in the values of poles and zeroes of a transfer function as input and gives the frequency plot, both absolute and bode and time response which includes step and impulse response as output.
The main objective of this project is to analyse the behaviour of the system by obtaining the frequency and time response plots for some given value of poles, zeroes and gain, as desired by the user. This helps the user to study transfer functions and system stability.
