# GUI-based-TFAP
The project is a GUI based transfer function analysis package programmed on Python using TKinter GUI package.
It takes in values of poles and zeroes of a transfer function.
Gives the frequency plot, both absolute and bode.
Gives time response which includes step and impulse response.

The main objective of this project is to analyse the behaviour of the system by obtaining the frequency and time response plots at some particular values of poles and zeroes as desired by the user. This helps the user to improve the understanding on the concept of transfer functions.
